# osu! pp scraper
This project reads a top performance list, downloads all the maps, runs oppai.exe on them, and gives you their aim/speed/accuracy values, as well as your combined pp stats. 
Example output can be seen [here](https://gn.s-ul.eu/DaYo7e7m).

The JSON handling is done by the [Gson library](https://github.com/google/gson), and is needed for compiling. No dependency manager for you.

Fair warning: the code is pretty bad.
